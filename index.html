        <h1>About Me, Page 1</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm a soft girl with a gentle heart, tahimik, mahiyain, pero sobra akong clingy once I’m comfortable. 
            I’m the type who loves hugs, kisses, and any kind of warm physical touch. Minsan jolly ako, 
            minsan nakakatawa, pero most of the time I’m calm, soft, and quiet.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m an overthinker, but I’m also mabait, masayahin, and surprisingly mature kahit playful ako. 
            I have a very long patience, and I always try to understand everyone around me. 
            I may be “mahina sa lahat ng bagay,” pero my heart is strong in loving people genuinely.
        </p>
        
           <h2> My Type (Friend + Personal Type)</h2>
            I’m the type of friend na palaging nandiyan, the listener, the loyal one, the “mother friend,” 
            the clingy one, and the super protective friend. When I care about someone, I really care deeply.  
            I’m soft, gentle, and full of affection. I give warm presence, quiet comfort, and silent loyalty.
        </p>

        <h2> What I Need</h2>
        <p>
            I need affection, understanding, honesty, reassurance, and someone who sees my softness as a strength.  
            I don’t ask for much — just warm love and gentle presence.
        </p>

        <h2> What I Want in Life</h2>
        <p>
            A simple and peaceful life.  
            To be loved genuinely.  
            To be appreciated.  
            To grow and heal slowly.  
        </p>

        <h2 id="contact"> Contact Me</h2>
        <div class="contact-box">

      <h2>The Other Side of Me</h2>
      <p>
        Turning 18 made me realize there’s another side of me I’m still learning.
        I’m not just the jolly, clingy, or moody version people already know —
        I’m someone who wants to grow, unlearn, and become better in ways that
        actually matter. I’m starting to understand myself more deeply, even the
        parts I used to ignore.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Learning Something New</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter feels like a season of learning. Learning how to choose
        myself, how to be patient with my emotions, and how to face unfamiliar
        things without fear. I want to try new experiences, explore new skills,
        and allow myself to be a beginner without feeling ashamed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Walking With God</h2>
      <p>
        As I step into adulthood, I also want to grow spiritually. I’m learning
        to follow God’s word, not perfectly, but sincerely. I want to trust His
        timing, seek His guidance, and let my faith shape the way I love, choose,
        and live. This is me choosing growth — with grace, faith, and intention.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What I Hope For</h2>
      <p>
        I hope to experience more of life — the quiet lessons, the unexpected
        joys, and even the hard moments that teach me strength. I want to keep
        learning, keep believing, and keep becoming someone I’ll be proud of,
        one step at a time.

    <h1>My Weaknesses, and My Strength</h1>
    
 <div class="section">
      <h2>My Weaknesses<h1>
      <p>
       I used to ignore some things that are noticeable in peoples eyes, Knowing that i 
      hate it when it makes me cry, or if its makes me feel alone and it’s also hard when  
      there is no one who's willing to listen to you when everything feels so heavy, and when 
      you just want to lean on someone you feel safe with—just to let out what you want to say
      what you’re feeling. It’s also hard when no one tells you, “You can do this. Of course 
      you can. I’m proud of you. But knowing that you're weak. you can't speak, you can't say 
      anything that you wanted to say just because you know 
      that they are not going to understand you on what your going to say just to understood.
     like you also wanted to say something that burdens you, or just to vent out on someone, 
     seeking for someones heartfelt words and support just to feel safe.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>My Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        My strength comes from having someone who understands the situation I struggle with, 
        or who sees me at my lowest and turns that into my strength. I admit that one of my 
        weaknesses is how much words affect me—when they understand me in a situation, whether 
        it’s a small or big part of my life, knowing that I am heard and understood.
        It’s hard to pretend that you can still handle everything and that you won’t give up, 
        even when it feels like you already are. But my true strength is being seen in the 
        little things—in words that cheer me up and genuinely give me more courage and 
        strength within myself.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>My Weakness and My Strength When comes to friendships and etc.</h2>
      <p>
        My weakness with the people I interact with is how they judge or look at you from head 
        to toe—as if they have so many things they want to say about you but can’t say them 
        out loud. You know how hard it is to deal with someone who has an ugly attitude; even 
        if they look good, they will still judge you.
        My strength with people, on the other hand, is those who have understanding and 
        empathy for others. Sometimes, the ones who seem bad are actually the truly kind ones, 
        and the ones who appear good in people’s eyes are the ones who are truly unkind. As 
        they say, don’t judge people and don’t belittle others.
        Many people suffer while trying to build themselves up just to be seen positively by 
        others, but deep inside, they are carrying something heavy that they can’t express. 
        That’s why we should spread respect and understanding toward others and be open to 
        every person’s opinion.
      </p>
    </div>
    Be kind always.
